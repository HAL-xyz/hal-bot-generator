# Hal's Bot Generator

Hal Collective inc. is proudly made up of a very lazy team ðŸ˜´. So, we thought about to create a script to auto-generate bots to keep track of some cool DeFi projects ðŸ˜Ž.

## How to install

Well, it's pretty simple. Just clone the repo then run:

```
yarn
```

Finally, use the `.env.example` file to create a `.env` file with correct variables.

And that's it! ðŸ¥³

## How to run the bot generator

| Dapp | Bot | Description | Script |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Yearn | Track yVault Deposit | Track deposits on vaults | |  `yarn run yearnTrackDeposit` |
| Yearn | Track yVault Withdrawal | Track withdrawals on vaults | |  `yarn run yearnTrackWithdrawal` |

Then, you can find some useful logs in `logs` directory.
